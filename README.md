## Description

_The purpose of this application is to feature what I have learned in the fifth week of coding bootcamp at Epicodus, specifically demonstrating knowledge of TDD. This business logic of this application can calculate the user's age on a variety of planets, as well as their how many years a user has left to live on each planet, as well as years lived past their life expectancy on earth on each planet._
